# The Pong Game

I'll be writing a Pong clone using the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) programming
language. The task should be fairly easy but I expect to gain some knowledge
about subscriptions for time and keyboard handling.

I'll also be using a build process based on [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) for
the first time.
